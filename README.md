C-Bus C-Gate C Library

This is a basic library for accessing clipsals C-Bus through C-Gate. Although Clipsal provide the CBM library which is great, it needs a dedicated PCI.

So far only lighting, measurement and text labeling is supported.

I plan on adding to it as time goes on and welcome any feedback.

Documentation is lacking but I will try to add some and an example application, but its very easy to get working.
