C-Bus C-Gate C Library

This is a basic library for accessing clipsals C-Bus through C-Gate. Although Clipsal provide the CBM library which is great, it needs a dedicated PCI.

So far only lighting is supported and a measurement callback. 

I plan on adding to it as time goes on and welcome any feedback.

Documentation is lacking but I will try to add some and an example application, but its very easy to get working.

## Next on the Todo list is 

  -add the rest of the measurement application
  -Dynamic labeling
  -HVAC Application
